    <h1>THURSDAY - objects</h1>

    <p>Objects are basic building blocks. Next we'll build components to display in the browser, store data as objects, and retreive data on our file system.</p>

    <p><strong>VISUALLY</strong> Objects have curly braces, contain keys and values separated by a colon, and the properties (key/value pairs) are separated by a comma. Arrays have square brackets. </p>
    
    <p><strong>CONCEPTUALLY</strong> Arrays are collections of similiar things. Objects are ways to define details of a single thing. Both an array and an object can be assigned to a variable.</p>
    
    <p><em>Never describe two things with a single object. Use an array to store two things inside of a single data structure.</em></p>
    
    <p>Values can be integers, strings, booleans, even arrays. There are two ways to access values stored inside an object: dot notation and square bracket notation.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Dot Notation</strong></p>
    <code>console.log(`Obtain a value inside an object ${variableContainingTheObject.keyName}`);</code>

    <p>Create a new key on an object - <code>variableContainingTheObject.keyName = "value"</code></p>
    
    <p><strong>Square Bracket Notation</strong></p>
    <code>console.log(variableContainingTheObject["keyName"]);</code>
